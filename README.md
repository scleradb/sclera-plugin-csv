# Sclera - CSV Connector

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scleradb/sclera-plugin-csv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scleradb/sclera-plugin-csv)

Enables Sclera to work with [CSV format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) data.

The CSV files are viewed as tables, and can be accessed in a manner similar to tables in a SQL query. You can also join the CSV file with tables in your database, with other CSV files, and aggregate the data as needed.

Further details on how to use the connector are in the [ScleraSQL Reference](https://scleradb.com/docs/sclerasql/sqlextdataaccess/#sclera-csv) document.

This is a sample component showcasing Sclera's ability to interface with external data. For the implementation details, please see the [Sclera Data Access Connector Development](https://scleradb.com/docs/sdk/sdkextdataaccess/) document.
